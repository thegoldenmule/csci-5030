* **Lecture**
    * Resolving Merge Conflicts
        * Merge Conflicts
            * A merge conflict occurs when work is done to the same section of code in two different branches.
            * Conflicts happen as a result of branching.
            * Branches give us isolation, but they can also gives us conflicts.
            * Conflicts don't need to be avoided, they need to be minimized.
            * Git can usually merge most conflicts without issue.
            * It cannot resolve binaries. It cannot resolve changes to the same lines of code.
            * Even when git does resolve a conflict automatically, **it may not be what you want**.
        * Types of Conflicts
            * Before
                * This happens when you have changes to the working file system or the staging file system.
                * Working File System
                    * stash, checkout
                * Staging Filesystem
                    * commit, reset
            * During
                * File differences
        * Identify the conflicts
            * status
        * Resolve the conflict
            * `diff`
            * Text editor.
            * Format of a conflict.
                * `<<<< HEAD`
                * `====`
                * `>>>> branch_name`
            * Visual editors exist too -- FileMerge, Araxis, BeyondCompare, etc.
            * `add` + `commit`
        * Abort mission!
            * `git merge --abort`
        * Toubleshooting
            * Great tips [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts).
            * `git checkout --`
            * `git reset --hard head`
